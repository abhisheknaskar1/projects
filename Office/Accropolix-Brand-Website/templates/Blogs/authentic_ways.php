                            People typically seek change because they face real challenges, not just for the sake of

                            effectively build rapport. This approach is key in <span class="font-weight-bold">

                            Instead of offering a dry, technical explanation of your services, show your prospects
                            that you genuinely understand and care about their issues. Aim to connect on an
                            emotional level, similar to a doctor with good bedside manner, to demonstrate that their
                            well-being is a priority for you. This personal touch is essential in <span

                            As you build rapport with prospects, focus on genuine solutions rather than just making

                            mind, even if it means advising against a purchase that isn’t beneficial. Prioritising
                            integrity may mean stepping back from a sale, but maintaining integrity in your
                            interactions can lead to lasting partnerships that are mutually beneficial. This
                            approach is critical in <span class="font-weight-bold"> relationship-building in
