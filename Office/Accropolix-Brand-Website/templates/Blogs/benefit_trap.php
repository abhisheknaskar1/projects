                    <p class="blog-intro blog-text-col-3">In today's time, sales teams are facing a perplexing reality:
                        a surge in leads isn't translating into a surge in revenue. Extensive research, including over
                        10,000 sales audits and 1,000+ call analyses conducted by our team of experts, reveals a stark
                        truth: once successful sales tactics are falling short.

                    <p class="blog-intro blog-text-col-3">Traditionally, sales reps have been trained to focus on
                        product features and benefits. This approach worked well in the past when buyers had limited
                        information and relied on salespeople to educate them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-intro blog-text-col-3">However, today's buyers are savvy, informed, and bombarded
                        with information. They don't want another sales pitch; they want solutions to their problems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-intro blog-text-col-3">When sales reps lead with features / benefits, it creates a

                        The Solution: Customer Pain-Led Sales (CPLS)
                    </h5>
                    <p class="blog-intro blog-text-col-3">CPLS is a sales methodology that flips the traditional script.
                        Instead of leading with features, you lead with customer pain points. This approach does a few
                        key things:

                            you can help them.

                        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Creates Value: </span> Focusing on pain points allows you to
                            clearly articulate how your product or service delivers value to the prospect.

                            to address those specific pain points. Use language that resonates with your audience and
                            demonstrates empathy.

                            start by asking questions to uncover your prospect's pain points. Listen actively and dig
                            deeper to understand the underlying issues.

                        to truly understand their customers' needs.
