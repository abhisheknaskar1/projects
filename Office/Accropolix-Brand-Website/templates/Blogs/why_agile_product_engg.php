                    <div class="blog-text-col-3" itemprop="articleBody">
                        <p>In modern software development, businesses need strategies that allow them to adapt
                            quickly to changing market demands and customer needs. Traditional development
                            models, such as the waterfall method, often fail to meet the dynamic requirements of
                            today's digital landscape. Agile Product Engineering provides an effective,
                            collaborative approach that has become critical for efficient software development.
                            By utilising Agile methodologies, teams can improve product quality, reduce risks,
                            and accelerate the delivery of software products.

                            Development?
                        </h2>
                        <p>Agile Software Development is a methodology centred on delivering functional software
                            through iterative, incremental cycles called "sprints." In each sprint, development
                            teams build small, manageable portions of the product, test them, and incorporate
                            stakeholder feedback before moving to the next iteration. This flexible approach
                            contrasts with the traditional waterfall model, which follows a linear sequence of
                            phases, often leaving no room for changes once a phase is completed.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Agile Manifesto defines key principles of Agile development, focusing on
                            individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and
                            adaptability to change. These core principles make Agile Software Development a
                            widely adopted framework in today’s software engineering landscape.
                        </p>

                            Development in Today’s Competitive Market
                        </h2>
                        <p>Agile Product Development plays a crucial role in helping businesses respond quickly
                            to market changes. Unlike traditional product development cycles, which often take
                            months or even years to complete, Agile splits the process into shorter iterations,
                            typically two to four weeks long. These iterations, or sprints, allow teams to
                            deliver working software more frequently, making it easier to incorporate real-time
                            feedback and course corrections as needed.</p>
                        <p>The flexibility provided by Agile Product Development not only helps teams adapt to
                            evolving customer requirements but also reduces the risk of failure. Early
                            identification of issues through continuous testing and feedback loops ensures that
                            necessary adjustments can be made during the development process, ultimately leading
                            to more successful project outcomes.

                            <li><strong>Kanban: </strong> Unlike Scrum, Kanban is more flexible and focuses on
                                visualising the workflow through a board. There are no fixed-length sprints, and
                                teams work on tasks as they come, focusing on minimising work-in-progress.
                                Kanban is ideal for projects requiring continuous delivery without strict time
                                constraints.
