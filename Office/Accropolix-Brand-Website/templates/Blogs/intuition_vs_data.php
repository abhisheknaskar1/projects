                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">We live in a time where data is produced in almost unimaginable amounts. Every year, we now produce over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day"><span class="font-weight-bold"> 120 zettabytes of data, </span></a> and by 2025, this is expected to rise to 181 zettabytes​.

                        Understanding Data Overload

                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        Data overload occurs when the sheer volume of information available exceeds our capacity to process it
                        effectively. This phenomenon can lead to decision paralysis, where making informed choices becomes increasingly
                        difficult because there's just too much information to handle. This challenge is prevalent in businesses where
                        making timely and accurate decisions is crucial for success.

                    </h5>
                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        Even with advancements in data processing technology, human intuition remains essential in decision-making. Intuition is our ability to understand something instantly, without needing to consciously think it through. It plays a crucial role alongside data, offering insights that numbers alone might not reveal. This becomes especially important in situations where data is missing or things are changing quickly, helping us navigate decisions that lack clear, numerical guidance.
