                        Key Features to Consider When Choosing ETL Tools
                    </h5>
                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        When selecting an ETL tool, scalability is essential to support both small and large data sets as your business
                        grows. This ensures the tool can handle increasing data volumes without performance issues.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        Cloud compatibility and hybrid integration are also critical, especially as many businesses operate across both
                        on-premise and cloud environments. The tool should integrate seamlessly with your existing infrastructure,
                        including data lakes, CRMs, and SaaS applications.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        Real-time processing is becoming increasingly valuable, enabling instant data insights. However, batch
                        processing may still be necessary for certain workloads, so a tool that supports both is ideal.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        Automation and low-code/no-code functionality help streamline deployment and reduce manual effort, allowing even
                        non-technical users to create data pipelines efficiently. This speeds up time-to-value and reduces development
                        costs, making it a critical feature for modern ETL tools.
                    </p>
                    <p class=" blog-text-col-3">
                        By considering these features, businesses can choose an ETL solution that aligns with their operational needs
                        and future growth.
