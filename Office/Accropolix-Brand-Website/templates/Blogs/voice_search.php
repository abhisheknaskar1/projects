                        The Rise of Voice Search:
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        With the growth of virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, voice search has become an integral part of how users seek information. It offers a hands-free and convenient alternative to traditional text-based queries.

                    <p> Unlike traditional text searches, voice queries tend to be more conversational in nature. Users ask questions or make requests in a manner they would communicate naturally. This shift demands a re-evaluation of SEO strategies to align with the way people speak rather than type.
