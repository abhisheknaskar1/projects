                        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Solving Real Problems: </span> Great products start with a deep understanding of customer needs and pain points. They solve real problems in a way that's both effective and delightful.

                        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Intuitive and Easy to Use: </span> No one wants to struggle with a product. Great products are intuitive and easy to use,even for first-time users.

                        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Reliable and Performant: </span> Users need to trust that a product will work as expected, every time. Great products are reliable and performant, even under heavy loads.

                        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Data-Driven Decision Making: </span> While intuition is important, data can provide valuable insights. Great products use data to inform decisions and measure success.
