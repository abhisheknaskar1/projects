                <p class="text-center">The organisation faces high employee turnover, disrupting operations and increasing hiring costs. This is due to a mismatch between employee skills and roles, leading to job dissatisfaction and poor engagement. Current HR strategies fail to meet evolving needs, with insufficient career advancement and development opportunities. Consequently, the company struggles to retain a stable workforce, impacting productivity and service quality, and necessitating a strategic overhaul of competency mapping to align talent development with organisational goals.</p>

                <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>The company operates in Sri Lanka’s maritime industry, offering services like ship chandlering, technical spares, and ship repairs. With 500 employees, it has grown steadily over the past 20 years, benefiting from Sri Lanka’s strategic location on international shipping routes. As the company expanded, the need for specialised skills became clear.</p>
                <p>However, a mismatch between employee skills and job requirements has caused inefficiencies and high turnover. This shows the urgent need for competency mapping to better align talent with the company’s needs.</p>
