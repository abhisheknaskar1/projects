                    The digital versions of international remittances have played pivotal roles in rendering swifter and convenient ways to execute monetary transactions. While these have largely eliminated various friction points, the cost of remittances has also been reduced to a great extent. Transferring money digitally makes the entire process instantaneous and eradicates tedious and error-prone processes. As per The World Bank, lowering remittance fees to 5% potentially provides an additional US$4 Billion annually to African families and regional communities. This may be attributed to the competitive exchange rates offered by digital versions.
