                    The widespread fraudulent activities in Digital businesses and services may be broadly categorised into Cyber Fraud, Intellectual Property Data Theft, amongst other IT frauds. Mitigating such frauds and risks is highly imperative for ensuring regulatory compliance. More critically, it fundamentally safeguards an Organisation from severest reputational damage, exposure to civil or criminal liabilities or hefty monetary penalties. From an Organisational perspective, having a robust fraud and risk mitigation system enables the Company to shift focus on other core functionalities and goals.

                    The PwC Global Economic Crime and Fraud Survey 2020 shows Financial Institutions losing a whopping $42 billion over the previous two years. As per the 2020 Global Fraud Study by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE), Companies bear an average revenue loss of 5% each year, owing to profuse frauds. This implies that fraud schemes around the globe bring about losses amounting to more than $3.6 billion dollars yearly. More alarming is the fact that the lack of a comprehensive fraud and risk mitigation system invariably engenders almost 34% of global fraud cases. Moreover, a recent 2020 EY Report finds startling surge in proliferations, misappropriations, counterfeiting and embezzlements amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. Such appalling figures firmly necessitate the need for advanced risk and fraud management in worldwide networks, and more so in affairs like international money transfer.

                    In an age of collaborative and global business activities, fraud and risk mitigation empowers an Organisation to acquire a much-needed holistic understanding of the fraud ecosystem and universe. While it is essential for ensuring customer satisfaction and retention, it also leads to financial benefits, eliminating the needs for outsourcing or third-party services. Precisely, by blending Predictive and Adaptive Techniques, Fraud and Risk Management Systems can potentially combat the modern sophisticated criminality that deviously manipulates the loopholes in law. Besides, an ideally Integrated Fraud Mitigation System can help get rid of the often erroneous manual processes.

                    Within the modern business and IT atmosphere, traditional fraud mitigation strategies may be bolstered with Machine Learning Strategies such as Deep Learning Neural Networks, Vector Machines and Extreme Gradient Promoting, along with proven mechanisms like Random Getup and Forests, Self-organising Maps and Logistic Reversion, all of which  can be greatly effective while dealing with complicated data patterns. Understandably, such methods can boost internal control systems substantially. In the long run, this can leverage real-time fraud detection that results in utmost compliance. Moreover, progressive solutions like Artificial Intelligence renders optimised flexibility whereby Organisations get the liberty to determine and adjust preferred levels of risk tolerance. Consequently, it enables the Organisation to operate in proactive and accurate manner while establishing custom fraud parameters.
