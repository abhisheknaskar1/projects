                    The advent of cloud-based services has undisputedly optimised cost-benefits and competitive
                    advantages for businesses. As per a Study by the International Data Group, almost 70% of
                    businesses utilise Cloud technology in one or multiple capacities. Moreover, a Dell Report
                    too finds that investing in Cloud accelerated revenue growth by a whopping 53%.

                    From an Organisational perspective, Cloud-based services are supremely beneficial in
                    maximising ROI (Return on Investments). This may be attributed to the “pay-as-you-go” model
                    that not only ensures cost savings but also improves data management. This is further
                    substantiated by the 2015 Bitglass Survey that saw more than 50% of CIO (Chief Information
                    Officer) and IT Leaders acknowledging cost-efficiency through cloud-based applications.

                    The prime differentiating factor in Cloud-based services is that of Security. Contrary to a
                    traditional in-house infrastructure, Cloud services potentially eliminate the threat of data
                    theft that might occur internally. Such features render Cloud Services practically
                    indispensable in sensitive affairs like international money transfer. According to a
                    RapidScale Report, approximately 94% of the businesses experienced supreme security measures
                    on transitioning to Cloud, with 91% opining that Cloud Technology ideally caters to
                    government compliance and regulatory requirements. The key to such amplified security
                    essentially lies in inherent data encryption that offers almost unbreachable centralised
                    resistance against cyber attacks and network disasters.

                    A defining survey by InformationWeek reported that 65% of the respondents had been inclined
                    towards Cloud Environment due to its capability to satisfy business demands with agility.
                    Precisely, by implementing Cloud Solutions, users are empowered to dispense with expensive
                    and tedious procedures of updating IT Systems. This can resolve many of the prevailing
                    issues of data storage, generating the desired flexibility in IT business. With advanced
                    Tracking Mechanisms and Integrated Analytics, Cloud-based services provide holistic view of
                    data, thereby facilitating customised reports and business insights.

                    It is perhaps understandable as to why Cloud-based services result in better quality
                    control. While conventionally managing information in silos has largely problematised
                    business services, Cloud has enabled consistent reporting, thus preventing data dilution.
                    Additionally, Cloud applications come with automatic software updates, therefore requiring
                    substantially lesser IT resources. The presence of such sustainability is firmly evidenced
                    in the Verizon Study that revealed more than 77% of the business considering Cloud
                    technology as engendering a superior competitive edge. On the other hand, the Cloud Industry
                    Forum (CIF) states that 78% UK Companies effectively use Cloud-based services, a figure that
                    is expected to increase exponentially in coming years. Such statistics bear testimony to the
                    diversified advantages of Cloud-based services, including swift deployment, along with
                    mobility, collaboration and scalability, all of which play crucial roles in streamlining IT
                    operations and services.
