                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Step 1: Research the Money Transfer Market</h2>
                        <p>Before you start developing your money transfer app, conduct extensive market research to understand the needs of your target audience. Identify key trends, pain points, and compliance requirements in regions like the UK, US, Canada, and India.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key Areas to Research:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="mb-2 blog-sec-layout">
                            <li><strong>User Behavior</strong> – Understand how users prefer to transfer money (bank accounts, mobile wallets, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong> – Study leading remittance solutions like PayPal, Wise, and Remitly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong> – Each country has specific licensing and regulatory requirements for money transfer software for business.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <!-- Step 2 -->
                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Step 2: Choose the Right Technology Stack for Your Send Money App</h2>
                        <p>Your app’s performance and scalability depend on the technology you use. Choosing the right tech stack ensures your remittance software can handle thousands of transactions securely and efficiently.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recommended Tech Stack:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="mb-2 blog-sec-layout">
                            <li><strong>Frontend</strong> – React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.</li>
                            <li><strong>Backend</strong> – Node.js, Python, or Ruby on Rails.</li>
                            <li><strong>Database</strong> – PostgreSQL or MongoDB.</li>

                        <h2 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Step 3: Design a User-Friendly Interface for Your Money Transfer Software</h2>
                        <p>An intuitive interface can make or break your send money app. Users must be able to navigate your app easily, whether they’re transferring funds from Canada to India or checking exchange rates.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tips for an Intuitive UI:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="mb-2 blog-sec-layout">
