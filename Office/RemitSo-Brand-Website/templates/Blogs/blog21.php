                                Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance is a critical aspect of maintaining the integrity of the financial system. Transaction monitoring, powered by robust AML rules, plays a crucial role in detecting and preventing illicit activities. To ensure effective transaction monitoring, consider incorporating these 10 critical AML rules into your team's workflow:
                            </p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>Structuring involves breaking down large transactions into smaller ones to avoid reporting thresholds. AML rules should be capable of identifying a high volume of transactions slightly below the reporting limit within a specified period.

                                    are just below the reporting threshold ($10,000 in this case) within a defined period, let's say 30 days.

                            <p>The role of international money transfer operators (IMTOs) is vital for the global economy. These businesses enable the movement of funds across borders, supporting families, businesses, and economies worldwide.With this responsibility comes the need for strict adherence to international regulations, particularly in the realm of sanctions screening. Failure to comply can result in severe penalties, reputational damage, and legal consequences. In this blog, we will get to know why sanctions screening is so critical for IMTOs and how it serves as a safeguard against potential risks.</p>

                            <h1>The Programming Language Myth: Why It’s Not Enough to Build a Successful Application</h1>
                            <p class="description">Choosing the right programming language is undoubtedly a crucial decision. It often sets the foundation for the
                                project’s architecture, performance, and maintainability. However, focusing solely on the choice of programming
                                language is like obsessing over the colour of a car while neglecting its engine.
                                While programming languages are essential, they are just one component of a much larger ecosystem required to build
                                a successful application. Here’s why relying solely on software language is not sufficient and why a broader
                                approach is necessary to build a successful running application in today’s modern generation.</p>
