                        </h3>
                        <p> Before launching, decide on the business model:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="mb-2 blog-sec-layout">
                            <li><strong>Fully Licensed Neobank – </strong> Requires a banking license and regulatory approval.</li>
                            <li><strong>BaaS-Based Neobank  – </strong> Partners with a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider.</li>
                            <li><strong>Niche-Specific Neobank –  </strong> Targets specific segments like freelancers, small businesses, or crypto users.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Each model has different regulatory and operational challenges, so choose wisely based on your funding and target audience.
                            </p>

                        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">Step 2: Secure Licensing and Regulatory Approval
                        </h3>
                        <p> Regulatory approval is one of the biggest hurdles in launching a neobank. Depending on your country, you may need:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="mb-2 blog-sec-layout">
                            <li><strong>A banking license </strong> (if operating independently).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>An Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license </strong> (for digital wallets and payment services).</li>
                            <li><strong>A partnership with an existing bank  </strong> (to bypass direct licensing requirements).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
