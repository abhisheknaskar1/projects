                        <h1><?php echo __('Advantages Of Cloud Based Services') ?></h1>
                        <p><?php echo __('The advent of cloud-based services has undisputedly optimised cost-benefits and competitive advantages for businesses. As per a Study by the International Data Group, almost 70% of businesses utilise Cloud technology in one or multiple capacities. Moreover, a Dell Report too finds that investing in Cloud accelerated revenue growth by a whopping 53%. ') ?></p>
                        <p><?php echo __('From an Organisational perspective, Cloud-based services are supremely beneficial in maximising ROI (Return on Investments). This may be attributed to the “pay-as-you-go” model that not only ensures cost savings but also improves data management. This is further substantiated by the 2015 Bitglass Survey that saw more than 50% of CIO (Chief Information Officer) and IT Leaders acknowledging cost-efficiency through cloud-based applications. ') ?></p>
                        <p><?php echo __('The prime differentiating factor in Cloud-based services is that of Security. Contrary to a traditional in-house infrastructure, Cloud services potentially eliminate the threat of data theft that might occur internally. Such features render Cloud Services practically indispensable in sensitive affairs like international money transfer. According to a RapidScale Report, approximately 94% of the businesses experienced supreme security measures on transitioning to Cloud, with 91% opining that Cloud Technology ideally caters to government compliance and regulatory requirements. The key to such amplified security essentially lies in inherent data encryption that offers almost unbreachable centralised resistance against cyber attacks and network disasters. ') ?></p>
                        <p><?php echo __('A defining survey by InformationWeek reported that 65% of the respondents had been inclined towards Cloud Environment due to its capability to satisfy business demands with agility. Precisely, by implementing Cloud Solutions, users are empowered to dispense with expensive and tedious procedures of updating IT Systems. This can resolve many of the prevailing issues of data storage, generating the desired flexibility in IT business. With advanced Tracking Mechanisms and Integrated Analytics, Cloud-based services provide holistic view of data, thereby facilitating customised reports and business insights. ') ?></p>
                        <p><?php echo __('It is perhaps understandable as to why Cloud-based services result in better quality control. While conventionally managing information in silos has largely problematised business services, Cloud has enabled consistent reporting, thus preventing data dilution. Additionally, Cloud applications come with automatic software updates, therefore requiring substantially lesser IT resources. The presence of such sustainability is firmly evidenced in the Verizon Study that revealed more than 77% of the business considering Cloud technology as engendering superior competitive edge. On the other hand, the Cloud Industry Forum (CIF) states that 78% UK Companies effectively use Cloud-based services, a figure that is expected to increase exponentially in coming years. Such statistics bear testimony to the diversified advantages of Cloud-based services, including swift deployment, along with mobility, collaboration and scalability, all of which play crucial roles in streamlining IT operations and services.

                        <p><?php echo __('RemitSo fully realises such cardinal aspects of IT frameworks in designing a unique security system for the needs of our clients.

Grounded on Role-based Access Management System, we make sure that messaging is unfailingly transmitted on Bank Grade SSL Security.
